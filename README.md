# model-extraction-attack
something that I made back in postgrad. 
This MEA (Model Extraction Attack) explores against a digit recognition system trained on the MNIST dataset.

has the aim to replicate a target model (LeNet CNN) by exploiting only black-box access (model predictions) without the access to the source codes, parameters or training checkpoints.

this work also has defense mechanisms to protect against model stealing by identifying adversarial queries by introducing noise into responses.
